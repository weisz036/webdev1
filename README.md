## Web Development - Lesson 1

### Introduction
You will be forking this repository, making updates to the code, and then pushing it up to your own repository.

### Resources
**Note: Be sure that you are giving proper citation if you re-used code that others have created**  
Some code citation resources:
 - [MIT Writing Code](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code)
 - [How to Cite Code, University of Arkansas](http://www.eat.lth.se/fileadmin/certec/Hector/How_to_cite_code.pdf)

### Task
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own Github account

2. Ensure that you can see the site on [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)
3. Clone it to a local repository and start a new branch.
4. Look through the code for the `** FIXME **` sections. There are instructions written in the comments that indicate what you need to do in each section. Sometimes it's fixing an issue with the code. Sometimes it will be adding to or altering the code.
5. Make changes to the code, commiting as you go along. 
6. Push your completed code up to whatever branch you are using for Github Pages and admire the results.

### Deliverable
After you are done:
1. Post a link to your forked repository on Canvas.
2. After this assignment is due, you will review the code of two of your classmates using [Github issues](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-your-work-with-issues/).
